Development of automatic classification and anomaly detection technology for internal network packets in connected cars

collecting CAN packets, the analysis method is presented to shorten the analysis time. 
For simplicity and time reduction in the CAN ID analysis process, a platform related to CAN ID analysis is established based on a connected car. 
The platform analyzes the CAN messages collected based on the scenario on a specific route and transmits the driving CAN data to the DB built in advance, and visualizes the amount of change in the CAN IDs based on the transmitted CAN messages. 
In addition, by detecting abnormal packets, it is possible to detect and prepare for a malicious attack on internal vehicular network.
